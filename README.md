This programm is a simple way to use a translation and retriew strings resources in your own software.

You will need to import it to your project. Four ways are possible :

* Build the jar, store it to your nexus (or other jar repository) and add a maven dependencie

* Build the jar and add a local maven dependencie

* Build the jar and add it as external library in your ide

* Add directly the sources to your projet
